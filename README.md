# Mathematics-of-Pandemics-SIR-MODEL
A code to Simulate the SIR model with restrictions 

Beta => Transmission Rate | Positive Real Number
gamma => Recovery Rate | Positive Real Number
C => Restrictions | [0,1] where 0 means total closure and 1 means no restrictions

S0 => Initial Percent of Susceptible People in the Total Population
I0 => Initial Percent of Infectious People in the Total Population
R0 => Initial Percent of Recovered/Removed People in the Total Population
